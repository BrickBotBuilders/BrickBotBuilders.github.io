    <h2>The Problem and Our Solution</h2>
    <p>Throughout the world, many researchers, scientists, hobbyists, and others strive to explore and learn about the ocean. However, for many, the costs of purchasing or building equipment is far too high or difficult. Our solution merges and takes inspiration from underwater <b>remotely operated vehicles (ROVs)</b> and <b>camera traps</b> on land, leading to a cost-effective solution that is almost 3x-1000x cheaper than a standard ROV. </p>
